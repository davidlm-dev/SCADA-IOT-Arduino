# SCADA System Project

This project is a full-stack SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) system designed for industrial monitoring and control. It integrates IoT with web technologies and modern DevOps practices.

## Project Overview

- **Hardware:** Arduino-based sensors and actuators for data acquisition and control.
- **Backend:** Node.js server with PostgreSQL database, JWT authentication, REST API, and MQTT communication.
- **Frontend:** React web application for real-time monitoring and control.
- **DevOps:** Docker containers, AWS deployment, and CI/CD pipelines (in progress).

## Features

- Real-time data acquisition and visualization.
- Secure user authentication and authorization.
- Scalable and maintainable architecture.
- Documentation available in `/docs` directory.

## Tech Stack

- Arduino, Node.js, PostgreSQL, MQTT, React, Docker, AWS, JWT
